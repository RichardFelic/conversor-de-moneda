# üè¶ **Currency Converter**

This project is an exchange rate converter application with management tools and a conversion history, developed using the **MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)** stack. It follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern to ensure a clear separation of business logic, user interface, and control flow, promoting better organization, scalability, and maintainability.
